"""
SnowCast Python utilities.

This package contains small scripts organized into logical modules:
- ``data``: DEM preparation and extraction utilities
- ``solar``: Solar calculation orchestration scripts
- ``viz``: Visualization and mapping tools
- ``utils``: Inspection and debugging helpers

The modules are intentionally lightweight; they are meant to be
called as command‑line utilities rather than as a full Python API.
